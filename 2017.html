            <p><a id="diversity"></a>1:00 to 2:30 PM in SCI 104<br>
            <b>FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY - WHY DEAFNESS IS NOT A HANDICAP (or is it?)</b> with Professor Beppie van den Bogaerde<br>
                Do you know what terms like 'audism' and 'surdophobia' mean? If you don't and want to find out, come to this workshop.<br>
            <span style="font-size:14px">
                Diversity is often considered in terms of race, gender or age and not in terms of functionality e.g. blindness of deafness. Two approaches toward deafness will be compared: the medical model versus the social/linguistic model. In the medical model, deafness is often negatively described as in, for instance, ‘hearing loss’, ‘hearing impaired’, ‘auditively handicapped’ or even ‘deaf-and-dumb’. In contrast, the terminology used for non-deaf (sic) people is positive: ‘normal hearing’ or ‘typically developing’. This negative framing of deafness has been explained as ‘audism’ (Humphries 1975) or ‘surdophobia’ (van Gils, 1997) in the social/cultural/linguistic model. Audism is the hearing way of dominating, restructuring, and exercising authority over the deaf community (Lane 1999:43). Surdophobia is a term coined by Van Gils (1997) and refers to the hearings’ fear of deaf professionals. The social/linguistic model considers deaf-born people to be a cultural minority with their own signed language; signing deaf people who identify as Deaf use terms like Deaf Pride, Deaf Gain and Deaf space when they talk about their culture. 
                <br> In this workshop we will discuss the two approaches, and discover our own biases. We will see how deaf-born, visual people view themselves, how they contribute to our society and what the role of sign language is in the Deaf communities. How can hearing people benefit from sign language, e.g. in learning or in communication?<br>

                Why people would pay $1000s for an in game item<br>
            <span style="font-size:14px">
                How can something that doesn't physically exist hold value? This class will explore thriving and very real examples of virtual economies in video games. We will also go over cryptocurrency for comparison. The course will cover some basic economics concepts and lead into an interdisciplinary look at the meaning of value in our market driven society.

            <span style="font-size:14px">
                This course will take a deeper look into mainstream social trends in American culture from the mid 90's to the present day. This exploration will be done through a close examination of Kanye West's career, starting from his days as a producer at the end of the last millennium and leading up to his efforts in fashion and politics in 2016. Prerequisite knowledge of Kanye West or hip-hop is not required, as everything you need to know will be covered. We will listen to snippets of West's music as well as view portions of his music videos and short films. At the end of the session, Yeezy will have taught you well.

            <b>Nature Vulvas: meditation, empowerment, yonic sculpture</b> with Bea Baker<br>
            Come spend some time in the Crum and make beautiful yonic sculptures from already beautiful nature!<br>
            <span style="font-size:14px">
                I spent February of 2016 in Dresden, more or less alone in a place where I was not yet proficient in the language and didn't know anyone. Lonely and bored, I started walking through the forest near my apartment often. I saw a red berry on the ground one day and thought, that is just like a bright, fat clitoris. From then, seed pods and leaves became labia, lichen became pubic hair, and the frozen forest floor became a canvas that I returned to once daily for a month. I used sculpture and presence in nature to focus, to meditate in a way I am normally not able to do.<br>
                Please come join me to create sculpted beauty from natural yonic beauty. We will construct ephemeral artwork that honors the vulva as a symbol of empowerment, appreciate our contribution to the makeup of the forest, and respect what the forest does with our work after we walk away.<br>
                Attendees can leave at their leisure, but should meet at the designated time.

            <p><a id="myth"></a>10:00 to 11:00 AM in SCI 145<br>
            <b>The Metamyth: Form and Texture of Fiction</b> with Victor Gomes and Zach Tucker<br>
            exploring modern mythic structure through television<br>
            <span style="font-size:14px">
                The search for narrative structures in ancient myths produced Campbell's conception of the monomyth, which allowed for a new comparative approach to analyzing and producing stories. Applying a similar framework to the modern, predominantly serialized "myths" of television can produce a new understanding of narrative structure, and what TV's "cultural heroes" signify about our society.</span></p>

            <b>Fractals and You</b> with Aaron Wagener<br>
                 The beauty of rough edges in mathematics<br>
            <span style="font-size:14px">
                What's the connection between coastlines, ferns, and your cell-phone antenna? Why is it hard to predict the weather? What is a Mandelbrot Set anyway? In this class we'll answer these questions by studying chaos and fractals, fields that deal with feedback loops, infinitely repeating details, and lots of crinkled edges. We'll see that systems with very simple rules can have completely unpredictable behavior, and we'll learn to interpret the pictures that are used to map these systems. If you've ever been bored all of the perfect shapes in math, this is the class for you. No college math background is necessary.
            </span></p>

            <span style="font-size:14px">
                We will explore the sestina, first reading some examples and talking about the form's defining characteristics and the effects that these qualities can have and why they have them. We are then going to talk about writing fixed form poems and the challenges and possibilities and possible solutions when writing a sestina before working together to write poems ourselves. All levels of prior experience with poetry and with this form encouraged to attend.

                "This course will be about how it is possible to draw from life anywhere, and how that practice can help you appreciate the world around you. The course will go over a variety of techniques and tools and ways to loosen up so that you aren't too afraid to draw. Even on a blank page. Even in public.<br>
                The idea of keeping a sketchbook will also be covered, including different types of sketchbooks and how to make a sketchbook really feel like it's your own. A sketchbook should feel comfortable, like home, where you can create and express the world around you and we'll talk about how you can make it that way. "

                Or, 'The Worldbuilding Authors Don't (but Should) Do'<br>
            <span style="font-size:14px">
                Have you ever wondered who washes elves' socks in the Lord of the Rings? Or why Muggle-born wizards don't just bring pens to Hogwarts? Or whether that meat dinner Ash Ketchum is eating used to be someone's Pokemon friend? If you have -- or if these unanswerable questions are now stuck in your mind -- come to 'Who Washes Elves' Socks?' to discuss what worldbuilding is, why it's important, and what authors leave out that, really, they should have considered. We'll also try our hand at some worldbuilding, and build our own worlds full of clean socks and ballpoint pens!

                Cryptography is now part of our daily life, but few people understand how it works, and what security it can truly promise. As we travel through the history of cryptography, we introduce its basic concepts, and show how advances in cryptography have influenced our world. We then explain how cryptography is used in modern times, and discuss the problems cryptographers are now trying to solve.
