The Delaware County Council has been entirely Republican for 100 years. The City of Chester, the poorest City in Pennsylvania and nearly three quarters black, had a Republican Mayor until 2012. Many consider the congressional districts that cut through the county and create a bewildering Rorschach the most gerrymandered in the United States. Lying behind all of this is the Swarthmore alumni and convicted racketeer John McClure, who Nixon visited at his home in 1960 to pay tribute, and the Republican Machine that has a had a grip on Delco since before World War I.
