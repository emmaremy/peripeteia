<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Peripeteia 2018 is happening <b>this weekend</b>, January 26-28! View <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2018">the schedule of events here</a>.</p>

<p>Peripeteia is an event where anyone can teach a
course on anything they like, academic or non-academic. Learn about past Peripeteia weekends <a href ="{{ site.baseurl}}/peripepast">here</a>. We also host panel discussions called <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/preludes">Preludes</a>.</p>

<p> The Peripeteia Planning Committee also manages a weekly digest of departmental events called <b>PILE</b>. So if you're a math major who wants to go to an art history talk now and then, this list can help remind you when and where they are. You can sign up to receive PILE's weekly emails <a href="http://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3by-dhDMsq8VKmbMgkzljHCJg4o7icaFOFfaiBIhZySxqww/viewform">here</a>.
