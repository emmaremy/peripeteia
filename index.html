			<h1>Welcome!</h1>

            <p><b>Peripeteia 2017 is approaching!</b> Look forward to a weekend of learning Friday, January 27 to Sunday, January 29. <a href="./2017.html">Check out the preliminary schedule and description of courses!</a></p>

            <p>The Peripeteia Planning Committee is pleased to announce a new project, called <b>PILE</b>: Peripeteia's Interdisciplinary List of Events. Basically, we'll be managing a list which says, for each week, which departments and other groups are hosting events that are open to the campus community, so that those outside of a given department can be aware of a departmental event that might interest them. So if you're a math major who wants to go to an art history talk now and then, this list can help remind you when and where they are. You can sign up to receive PILE's weekly emails <a href="http://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3by-dhDMsq8VKmbMgkzljHCJg4o7icaFOFfaiBIhZySxqww/viewform">here</a> or email jmundo1@swarthmore.edu with the subject "PILE Sign-up".</p> 

        <p>Peripeteia is an event where anyone can teach a
            course on anything they like, academic or non-academic.
            We also host panel discussions called <a href="./preludes.html">Preludes</a>.</p>

            <p>If you missed Peripeteia 2016, or want to know more about it, you can find <a href="./2016.html"</a> more information
            about Peripeteia 2016 here.</a></p>

            <p>You can learn more about Peripeteia in general by contacting
            swatperipeteia@gmail.com, on our <a href="about.html">
                about page</a>, or by contacting any of the members
            of the Peripeteia planning committee.</p>

            <p>If you're interested in helping organize Peripeteia, please let us know! (especially if you are a
            freshman or sophomore)</p>
