            <a id="whatis"></a>
            <p><b>What is Peripeteia?</b></p>
            <p>Peripeteia is a festival with the aim of encouraging community members (students/staff/faculty)  to lecture, lead a workshop, teach a skill...to share something they're enthusiastic about! The purpose of Peripeteia is to create a platform for all voices to be heard, and to combat departmental isolation through a new campus-wide (and eventually community-wide) event, Peripeteia embraces knowledge for the sake of knowledge, as well as the belief that diversity in knowledge is the ultimate goal of the liberal arts.

            <p>We also host panel discussion events called <a href=./preludes.html>Preludes</a>, manage a weekly newsletter compiling events across departments called <a href="./pile.html">PILE</a>, and help host and other events with goals in line with the goals of ideals of Peripeteia.</p>

            <p>We will release a link to the sign-up form soon. Keep in mind that the sign-up is not a test, nor is it totalizing. We want to help you build a great class!

We'll contact as you soon after you sign up, so if you're confused or unsure about any parts of the sign-up form or would like to give us additional information, keep in mind that we'll be in touch. If there's any confusion, contact us!</p>

            <p><b>When do I have to sign up to teach a course at Peripeteia 2017 by? Also, when is Peripeteia?</b><p>
            <p>The next Peripeteia will be the weekend of <b>January 27-29th, 2017</b>. We'll put together a class schedule as people sign up to teach! Sign-ups are due by <b>December 1, 2016</b>.</p>

            <p><b>What kinds of courses can I teach?</b></p>
            <p>Knowledge for its own sake is one of the core tenets of Peripeteia. For this reason we encourage all participants to submit any ideas - no matter how unusual. Peripeteia is a platform to give all areas of knowledge equal footing, regardless of their institutional position. Whether you use it to share the academic research you've been working on these past years, or an area of knowledge you've gained through lived experience--or even a unique hobby or skill, is up to you!</p>
            <p>Experimentation is also key, and we'd like to open the possibility of all types of class formats. If you feel that the best way to share your knowledge is through a hands-on workshop, a hike through the Crum, a seminar or lecture, or something we haven't even thought of yet, then talk to us, and we can figure out a way to implement your ideas.</p>
            <p>Past classes: Fractals and Chaos, How do birds fly?, Storytelling and Radical Empathy Workshop, What is Ballet?, Hip Hop Habitats (see the full list with descriptions <a href="./schedule.html">here</a>)</p>

            <p><b>I have an idea for a course, but I'm not sure how to teach it.</p></b>
            <p>We're happy to brainstorm with you, or we can help put you in touch with other members of the campus community who have knowledge or experience relevant to your course topic. We're here to help! Just let us know what you need or want.</p>

            <a id="materials"></a>
            <p><b>I don't know if I'll be able to supply all the materials for my class?</p></b>
            <p>We are fortunately funded by the Dean's Office Community Development Grant! We will try to help you get the resources you need.</p>

        <a id="relatedevent"></a>
        <p><b>I am interested in hosting my own event with similar goals to Peripeteia. Will Peripeteia advise or collaborate with me?</b></p>
        <p>Contact us! We have collaborated with/advised groups in the past.</p>

        <a id="preludeidea"></a>
        <p><b>I have an idea for a Prelude.</p></b>
        <p>If you have an idea for a Prelude, contact us and we can talk about it!</p>

        <a id="peripeteio"></a>
        <p><b>Isn't Peripeteia the Christian discourse journal?</b></p>
        <p>We apologize for the confusing naming; the Journal is called Peripateo, and we are not affiliated with it. <p>

        <a id="meaning"></a>
        <p><b>What does Peripeteia mean? How do I even pronounce it?</b></p>
        <p>Peripeteia (pronounced /pair-uh-puh-tay-uh/) means "to fall around or about" and is a term we borrowed from Aristotle which is used in literary analysis to mean a reversal of circumstances or change of fortune. We chose the name because we hope for it to be a positive change in the liberal arts setting here at Swarthmore.</p>
